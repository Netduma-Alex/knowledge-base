# Network Activity on DumOS 4

Network Activity lets you break down your network usage to spot programs/devices that are hogging bandwidth, in real-time or over any range of time.

## Understanding your usage

To get a clear picture of your current network usage, select Now as your time-range and choose between Download, Upload or All Usage. You can view your total usage in Megabits Per Second (Mbps) on the line chart, and check which activity is using the most in the list.

Switching to historical time-ranges will display your usage as a bar chart. Try checking your daily usage to spot trends that could be affecting your gameplay or causing congestion.

To dig even deeper into your usage, you can press on devices / activities in the list to learn exactly what theyâ€™ve used over the chosen timespan.
