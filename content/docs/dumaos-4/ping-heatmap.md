## Understanding your ping

To learn the quality of the servers available to you, try choosing a game. You’ll see game servers appear on the map, and generally those nearest to your location will have a better connection than more distant ones. The lower your ping, the more responsive your gameplay will feel.

We’ll keep Ping Heatmap up to date with the latest games over the cloud, so you’ll always have the best insight into new releases before anyone else.

## Ping Schedules

By creating a schedule, you can track the server quality of your favourite games to see what times are best for playing. Just go to Ping Schedules and press Add New to get started.

Once your schedule is made, you can use the History slider to see how the server quality for your chosen game varies over time. You can also check out history for individual servers by tapping on them and choosing a time range.
