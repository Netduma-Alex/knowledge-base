# Accessing DumaOS

DumaOS is a powerful router operating system that gives you control of your home network.

It is pre-installed on the NETGEAR Nighthawk XR500, XR450 and XR700. 

## Setting up your Router

The first step in accessing DumaOS on your router is to connect a PC or laptop to your router. You can do this either with a wired or wireless.

If using WiFi, search for your router’s Wi-Fi name (SSID) and enter the password.

- On the Netduma R1, the default name is 'Netduma R1' and the password is the serial number taken from the label on the bottom of the router (do not enter the '/' and the final three characters after it. 
- On the R2, the SSID will be NetdumaR2 and the password is printed on the underside of the router.
- On the Nighthawk routers, the default name and password are on a label on your router 

## Accessing the UI

DumaOS is compatible with most Internet browsers. For the best experience we recommend using Google Chrome; although you can use Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer 11 as well.

In your browser, type the following into your address bar:

- **Netduma R1 users should type:** 192.168.88.1
- **Netduma R2 users should type:** 192.168.77.1 OR simply use [http://dumaos/](http://dumaos/)
- **Nighthawk users should type:** routerlogin.net or the router’s LAN IP address (which by default is 192.168.1.1) into the address bar 

You will then be asked to sign into your router. The default details are:

> **admin**
> **password**

Make sure to type these in lower case and in English
