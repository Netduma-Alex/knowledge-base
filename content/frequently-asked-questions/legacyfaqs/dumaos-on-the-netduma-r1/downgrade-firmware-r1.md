title: Downgrading back to the Original R1 Firmware from DumaOS
---

1. Download the latest Original R1 Firmware [**here**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/701ezvt4qmezdgu/R1-v-1-03-6j.sig?dl=0)
2. In the top right hand corner of the DumaOS interface click the Upgrade button (![upgradebutton.png](downgrade-firmware-r1/upgradebutton.png))
3. Click ‘Select Upgrade File’ & navigate to where you downloaded the upgrade file and click open.
4. Click ‘Upgrade’ and wait a few minutes 
5. Then try to access the R1 interface by typing in [192.168.88.1](http://192.168.88.1) or [http://R1](http://R1.%C2%A0) 
6. Your browser may try to redirect you to [http://192.168.88.1/desktop/index.html#com.netdumasoftware.desktop](http://192.168.88.1/desktop/index.html#com.netdumasoftware.desktop) which will prevent you from accessing the original R1 firmware interface. To get around this problem, clear the cache on your browser (ctrl + F5 on Windows usually solves this). Or alternatively, use a different browser (e.g. Firefox) or open your browser in incognito / private browsing mode
7. If you are still unable to connect double check that your WiFi has not automatically connected you to a different network while you were waiting. If this has happened, reconnect back to the Netduma R1
