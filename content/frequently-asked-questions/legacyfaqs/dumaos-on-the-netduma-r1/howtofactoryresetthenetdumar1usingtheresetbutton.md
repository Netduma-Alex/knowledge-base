If you are are not able to access the user interface to factory reset your router, you can manually push the reset button down on the back of your Netduma R1. Follow these instructions:

1. Make sure your Netduma R1 is powered on 
2. Using a small, thin object like the tip of a pen or a paperclip, push down firmly on the Reset button found on the back of your Netduma R1. It's a small hole which says 'RES' above. Continue to press down until you see all the lights blink on and then off
3. Stop holding the button down and wait to hear a beep. Your router is now factory resetting. Wait for about 1 minute for the factory reset to complete
4. After the factory reset has completed, please note the following:
   - The WiFi name is **Netduma R1**
   - The password is now **netdumar1**
   - To access the user interface, enter 192.168.88.1 into the address bar
   - the default credentials are **admin** and **password  -** make sure you type these in English and lower case
5. You should now be able to access your R1 which has been restored to default settings. To setup your router optimally, we recommend you follow these guides: [DumaOS Optimal Settings Guides : NETDUMA](http://support.netduma.com/en/support/solutions/folders/16000090646)
