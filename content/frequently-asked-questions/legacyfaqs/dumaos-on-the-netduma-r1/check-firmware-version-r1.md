title: How do I check my R1 firmware version number?
---

1. On a PC or Laptop connect to your Netduma R1 router. You can do this using a wired Ethernet cable, or by connecting to the router wirelessly
2. Open a web browser, like Google Chrome
3. In the address bar, type in 192.168.88.1 and press enter
4. The Netduma user interface should open. If it does not, please try typing in [http://r1/](http://r1/) instead
5. Once on the user interface, scroll to the very bottom of the page. You should be able to see the version number. It will look something like this:

If you are on version 1.03.5m or lower, for example 1.03.3, **DO NOT** upgrade your router. We will need to manually run a fix on your router to prevent it from breaking on upgrade. Please see [this guide](/frequently-asked-questions/legacyfaqs/dumaos-on-the-netduma-r1/upgrade-from-lower-r1/) for further instructions.
