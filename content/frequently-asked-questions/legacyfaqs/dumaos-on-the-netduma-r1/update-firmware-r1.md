title: Upgrading to a newer version of DumaOS on the Netduma R1
---

This guide will explain how to upgrade your version of DumaOS to a newer version. If you do not currently have DumaOS installed on your Netduma R1, please see separate instructions here: [Upgrading your Netduma R1 to DumaOS from the original R1 firmware : NETDUMA](http://support.netduma.com/en/support/solutions/articles/16000085793-upgrading-your-netduma-r1-to-dumaos)

1. Download the latest firmware for the Netduma R1. At the time of writing, during    the Open Beta, you will receive this in an email from [netduma@netduma.com](netduma@netduma.com) (so long as you have signed up to the [**Open Beta**](https://netduma.com/r1-dumaos/)) 
2. Go to your R1 interface (usually at 192.168.88.1) (if this is your first time installing DumaOS, the default login is **admin** and **password** *(type this in English)*
3. In the top right corner, click the icon that looks like a clock with a circular arrow around it.
4. Select the upgrade file from wherever you saved it onto your PC then click Upgrade. 
5. It will take about 60 seconds for your R1 to upgrade, so please be patient. DO NOT POWER OFF YOUR ROUTER DURING THIS TIME
6. You should automatically be taken back to the interface. If this does not   happen, check your PC hasn't connected you to a different WiFi whilst the R1 was temporarily offline
