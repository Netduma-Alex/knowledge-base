title: What does ‘Share Excess’ do?
---

Share Excess automatically 
allocates any unused bandwidth to a device that needs it. Unchecking 
Share Excess caps the percentage allocated to each device, preventing 
unneeded bandwidth from being shared across your network. We recommend 
you keep this option checked.
