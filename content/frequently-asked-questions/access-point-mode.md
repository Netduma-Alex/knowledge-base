title: Can you use DumaOS in Access Point mode?
weight: 7

The Netgear Nighthawk Pro Gaming routers will allow you to go into access point mode. However the vast majority of DumaOS features will not function in this mode. It would be a much better idea to put the Netduma into the DMZ of the router above it.
No other DumaOS hardware will allow you to use Access Point mode.
