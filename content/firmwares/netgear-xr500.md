Most of the time you will be able to upgrade your NETGEAR Nighthawk Pro Gaming XR500 using the built in automatic update tool. However there are some scenarios where you may need to manually download and install a firmware.

This guide will detail the process.

## Downloading the firmware files

Download the correct firmware files for your unit. These will contain the model number in the title and will be in .chk format. Do not attempt to install any firmwares which are not specifically intended for your unit.

Official firmware files can be downloaded directly from Netgear here:
[XR500 Firmware](https://www.netgear.com/support/product/xr500/#download)

## Installation steps

After you've downloaded the firmware to your PC, log onto the DumaOS frontend, then go to Settings > Administration > Router Upgrade > Browse > Upload.

Your router will restart during the process, so you'll lose internet access for a few minutes. Also, make sure not to unplug the unit during the upgrade, as this could potentially brick your unit.
