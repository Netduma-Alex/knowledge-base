This section contains links to all of the latest firmwares available for DumaOS.

These firmwares introduce bug fixes and new features.

If you're on DumaOS 4, you don't need to manually upgrade, as there is a one-click-update system.

However the firmwares are all available here in case you would like to roll-back for any reason.
