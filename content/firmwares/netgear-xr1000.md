Most of the time you will be able to upgrade your NETGEAR Nighthawk Pro Gaming XR1000 or XR1000v2 using the built in automatic update tool. However there are some scenarios where you may need to manually download and install a firmware.

This guide will detail the process.

## Is your router a V1 or a V2?

There are two versions of the XR1000 on the market. They are identical in terms of functionality, but some of the internal components were changed. Because of this, they require separate firmware files.

Log onto DumaOS in your browser by visiting routerlogin.net while connected to your home network. The version number at the top right of the screen will either say "xr1000" or "xr1000v2". Make a note of this.

## Downloading the firmware files

Download the correct firmware files for your unit. These will contain the model number in the title (xr1000 or xr1000v2) and will be in .chk format. Do not attempt to install any firmwares which are not specifically intended for your unit.

Official firmware files can be downloaded directly from Netgear here:
[XR1000 Firmware](https://www.netgear.com/support/product/xr1000/#download)
[XR1000v2 Firmware](https://www.netgear.com/support/product/xr1000v2/#download)

## Installation steps

After you've downloaded the firmware to your PC, log onto the DumaOS frontend, then go to Settings > Administration > Router Upgrade > Browse > Upload.

Your router will restart during the process, so you'll lose internet access for a few minutes. Also, make sure not to unplug the unit during the upgrade, as this could potentially brick your unit.
